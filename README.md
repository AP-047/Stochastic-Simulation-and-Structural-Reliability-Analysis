# Stochastic Simulation and Structural Reliability Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB code and results for a project on **Stochastic Simulation and Structural Reliability Analysis**, conducted during the Summer semester of 2024.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the structural reliability of systems under uncertainty using **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** and **Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)**. The analysis incorporates **random material properties** to assess failure probabilities and reliability indices.

### Key Features:
- **Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)** to estimate **failure probability (pf)** and **reliability index (Î²)** for structural systems.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** for heat flow and structural displacement analysis with random material properties.
- Implementation of **First Order Reliability Method (FORM)** and **Adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS)** using **MATLAB** and **UQLab** frameworks.
- Convergence analysis of reliability methods to ensure accuracy in reliability estimates.
